# Journey_Detour
This project is a WIP.

Currently working functions:

Console I/O.

Some useful concommands.

Running lua code from within the console.

Hotkeys(need to define in code).

How to use:

Download the release dll or compile your own 

Inject the dll into journey.exe with any working injector.

Such as: CheatEngine , Extreme Injector.

console commands:

script : run Lua script code from console. | example: script ToggleDMActive(game)

queuelevel: load a map with map name. | example: queuelevel Level_Graveyard

netgui: toggles netgui. | example: netgui

(you can now press enter to do netgui execute.)

I will add more concommands as this project goes on.
